# TaxiAI

An AI university project. Involves several taxis going around a city, picking up customers and collecting their fares. Customers call a handler which checks for available taxis. They are then chosen based on the closes estimated distance, including possible traffic.
The pathing is done with a A* algorithm and decisions are made based on logic and estimations.
